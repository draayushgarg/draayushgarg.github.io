Research & Development Experience
-
**Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.list.lu), Luxembourg from March 2024 to Present**
- Aayush is developing new methods by employing DL/LLMs to improve the security of SDLC by identifying software vulnerabilities.
- He is employing AI solutions to prevent cyber attacks utilizing Fuzzers, by automatically detecting such attacks and by implementing software self-healing solutions focusing on automatically generating vulnerability patches.
- He is developing automated solutions to identify the attack vectors (in the context of a 5G-core network) and to prevent an unauthorized user from entering or extracting data from the environment.

**Researcher at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)](https://www.uni.lu/snt), [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu), Luxembourg from July 2019 to March 2024**
- Aayush designed solutions harnessing AI, especially Deep Learning to automatically define and learn features from source code representation replacing 100% manual effort.
- He trained Neural Networks and Machine Learning models to achieve task-specific classifications with up to 87% Precision and Recall.
- He employed LLMs and GPTs to induce artificial faults enabling up to 65% increased test effectiveness in detecting zero-day vulnerabilities.

**Teaching Assistant at the [Faculty of Science, Technology and Medicine (FSTM)](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-en), [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu), Luxembourg from July 2019 to May 2023**
