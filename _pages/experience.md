Research Experience
-
**Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.list.lu), Luxembourg since March 2024 (at present)**
- Aayush continues to develop new methods employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve software security by focusing on software vulnerabilities, both real (existing) and artificial.
- He is exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) in implementing software self-healing focusing on automatically generating source code patching vulnerabilities.
- Aayush is designing a semi-automated framework to transform real-world threat intelligence into executable cyber range scenarios, with the goal of delivering realistic, threat-informed, and role-specific cybersecurity training exercises.
- He is developing automated solutions to identify the attack vectors (in the context of a 5G-core network) in order to prevent unauthorized entrance and/or extraction of telecom data.
- He employed Deep Learning (DL), primarily Transformers architecture to automatically identify API fuzzing attack patterns, in order to tackle cyber attacks utilizing Fuzzing.

**Doctoral Researcher at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT)](https://www.uni.lu/snt), [University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu), Luxembourg from July 2019 to March 2024**
- Aayush designed solutions harnessing AI, especially Deep Learning to automatically define and learn features from source code representation replacing 100% manual effort.
- He trained Neural Networks and Machine Learning models to achieve task-specific classifications with up to 87% Precision and Recall.
- He employed LLMs and GPTs to induce artificial faults enabling up to 65% increased test effectiveness in detecting zero-day vulnerabilities.
