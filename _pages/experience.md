Research Experience
-
**Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.list.lu), Luxembourg since March 2024 (at present)**
- Aayush continues to develop new methods employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve software security by focusing on software vulnerabilities, both real (existing) and synthetically generated.
- He is exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in implementing software self-healing, focusing on automatically generating source code patching vulnerabilities.
- He is developing automated solutions to identify the attack vectors (in the context of a 5G-core network) to prevent unauthorized entrance and extraction of telecom data.
- Aayush employed Deep Learning (DL), primarily Transformers architecture, to automatically identify API fuzzing attack patterns, in order to tackle cyber attacks utilizing Fuzzing.
- He is developing automated assurance techniques to ensure the quality of Generative AI-enabled educational activities.
- Aayush is designing a semi-automated framework to transform real-world threat intelligence into executable cyber range scenarios, with the goal of delivering realistic, threat-informed, and role-specific cybersecurity training exercises.
